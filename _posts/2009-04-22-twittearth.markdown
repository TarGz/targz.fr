TwittEarth, like realtime dataviz of Tweet from all around the world.
This was an experiment of using the Twitter API at the time Tweet weren't geolocalised.
I had some cool article On TechCrunch ["TwittEarth, is eye-candy at its finest"](https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/20/twittearth-makes-twitter-a-global-experience/)
